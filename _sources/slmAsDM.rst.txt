Using SLM as a DM
=================

You can use the SLM as if it where a DM. To do so, first create a SLM object:

.. code-block:: python

    slm = SLM()
    
.. warning ::
	
    Don't forget to start the SLM server on the windows machine, please refer to SEAL google doc to do so.
    

Then you can define your DM based on the SLM by running:

.. code-block:: python

    nAct_across = 5
    c = 0.5
    dm_slm = DM_seal('slm',slm,[nAct_across,c])
    
where nAct_across is the number of actuator across the pupil, and c is the actuators coupling factor.

.. note ::
	
    For time constrain issues, no matter what value nAct_across is, only 100 Zernike modes will be controlled by the DM. If it is an issue, please contact moderator.
    
Then the SLM can be controlled as a DM.
