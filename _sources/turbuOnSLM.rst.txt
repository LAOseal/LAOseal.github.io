Applyting turbulence on SLM
===========================

You can use the SLM to generate turbulence.

.. note::

    SLM can be used as a DM and to create turbulence simultaneously, it will create the different phasemap on different channel. Check SLM object for more details.
    

First, create SLM object.

.. code-block:: python

    slm = SLM()

Define turbulence parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    telescope_diameter = 1.5
    wavelength = 635*1e-09
    fried_parameter = 0.1
    velocity = 5
    outer_scale = 40
    timeSampling = 0.001
    
Then you can create the atmosphere object, and put the SLM object in these arguments.

.. code-block:: python

    turbu = atm(telescope_diameter,wavelength,fried_parameter,velocity,outer_scale,timeSampling,slm)
    
You can then apply turubulence by running:


.. code-block:: python

    time = 1
    turbu.setTurbu(time)
    
where time is the time for which you display turbulence (in seconds).
