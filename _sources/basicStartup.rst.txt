Basic startup
=============

If you just want to close loop on statics and have access to DM objects to perform tests around falt wavefront, open iPython terminal and launch:

.. code-block:: python

    run /home/lab/libSEAL/quickStartup.python

If you choose to close loop on both DMs (ALPAO and MEMS), you can then control them in the iPython terminal. 
The ALPAO DM object is saved in the variable:

.. code-block:: python

    dm_alpao

The MEMS DM object is saved in the variable:

.. code-block:: python

    dm_mems

.. note::

    ALPAO DM shape tends to move in open loop, usually low aberrations are created in few minutes if loop stay open. You can close the loop again by launching: controller.closeLoop(10)
