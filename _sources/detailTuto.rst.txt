==============

Here is an example to close the loop on the bench by yourself, not using the quickStartup script.

First, import all the library modules:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    sys.path.append(r"/home/lab/libSEAL")
    from wfAffectors import *
    from wfSensors import *
    from wfControllers import *
    from cameras import *
    from turbulence import *
    from tools import *


Create the DM object, in this example we will use the ALPAO DM.

.. code-block:: python

    dm_alpao = DM_seal('alpao')

Create the WFS object, in this example we will use the SHWFS.

.. warning::

    Don't use SHWFS and MEMS DM together, as the SHWFS doesn't have enough subapertures to handle this DM.


.. code-block:: python

    SH = SHWFS()

Then, you can launch the ALPAO DM / SHWFS calibration:

.. code-block:: python

    SH.calibrate(dm_alpao)

Creating a controller object and closing the loop:

.. code-block:: python

    controller = integrator(SH,dm_alpao)
    controller.loopgain = 0.3
    controller.closeLoop(30)
